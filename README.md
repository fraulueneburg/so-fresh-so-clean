## Introduction

Why build something cool and fun when you can build something truly evil? Thatâ€™s what my project partner Ronny and I asked ourselves when planning our second app project during the Ironhack 2023 Web Dev Bootcamp.

So we built the thing that made everyone think we were the worst: A cleaning schedule app for shared flats! Complete with all the CRUD operations and a special bonus feature: If you didnâ€™t complete your tasks on time, you will be shamed by a sad animal and a passive-agressive message (we sincerely wish this one wasnâ€™t based on a true story).

## Features

- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ§¹&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>create a site for your flat(s)
- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ§¼&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>add, update and delete your flatmates
- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ¤©&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>create tasks that automatically repeat every week
- <span aria-hidden="true">âœ…&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>keep track of completed/uncompleted tasks
- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ˜¿&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BONUS: A passive-aggressive message and a sad baby animal shame you about due/missed tasks
- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ‘Œ&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BONUS: If you did complete your tasks on time, you will get a random cleaning tip.

## Some Evil Feature Ideas (because weâ€™re really bad people)

- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ˜ˆ&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ratings: leave a public review of your flatmateâ€™s cleaning skills on their profile
- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ˜ˆ&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>paypal-integration: automatically get charged a fixed sum if you didnâ€™t complete your tasks on time
- <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ˜ˆ&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>basically build an empire of true evil

## Technologies used

- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- _painful life experience of living in a flat with a very (!) rigid cleaning schedule_
